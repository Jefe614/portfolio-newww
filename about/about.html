            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <h1>Frontend Developer</h1>
            <p>I'm Geoffrey Kimani, a web developer with a passion for creating clean and modern websites. I love taking on new challenges and working collaboratively with other developers and designers to create engaging web experiences</p>
        </div>

        <p>I specialize in designing and developing the user interface (UI) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to create a seamless user experience by designing and implementing intuitive navigation, responsive layouts, and engaging animations.
            I am well-versed in front-end development frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue, and have experience with CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less. I am also familiar with task runners such as Gulp and Grunt, which help me automate repetitive
            tasks and streamline my workflow. In addition to technical skills, I have a strong eye for design and a keen sense of aesthetics. I understand the importance of creating visually appealing and accessible websites, and strive to make sure that
            all of my projects are user-friendly and accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. As a Front-End Developer, I am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the user experience, and am passionate about creating
            cutting-edge web experiences that engage and delight users.</p>
